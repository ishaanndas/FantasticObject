# FantasticObject
The object I would like to mnake would be a Multilingual physical keyboard. All the keys on this object would be tiny touch-screen LEDs, changing language based on user input through the connected device (PC).
There are approximately 33 billion bilingual people worldwide, accounting for 43% of the population. Just 17.5% of UK adults are bilingual. Spanish is the most popular second language to learn in the US. Being bilingual myself, I feel this keyboard would benefit a lot of people, allowing easy typing in multiple languages without having to settle for a purely digital interface.
